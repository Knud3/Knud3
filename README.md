I have a lifetime passion for technology, driven by a curiosity to understand how things truly work and master them. I'm a problem-solver at heart, motivated by the challenge of learning new things and applying that knowledge to complex projects.

I'm a firm believer in automation and scripting. Whether utilizing Bash, PowerShell, or other tools, manual repetition of tasks represents a missed opportunity to engineer robust, secure, and scalable solutions.

I am at home with any OS, provided it allows for modification and tinkering. I enjoy architecting and building systems from the ground up, such as deploying fully automated Grafana monitoring stack on Kubernetes. This covers everything from containerizing applications with Docker and orchestrating them with Kubernetes, to deploying the underlying infrastructure using IaC tools like Terraform, Ansible, Helm, Kustomize, and Skaffold.

My interests also extend to home lab setups and self-hosting, where I explore virtualization with Proxmox and containers, advanced networking with pfSense Plus plus MikroTik, and services like Home Assistant and Matrix homeservers. I'm a strong advocate for Open-Source. Currently immersing myself in the realm of AI.

And, of course, everything looks better in Dracula theme. If an application lacks support for it, I embrace the personal challenge of implementing it, as my retinas are simply intolerant of excessive luminosity.

When I'm not tinkering with technology, I counterbalance my technical side by hiking in nature with my camera. My other hobbies include listening to music, carpentry, PC gaming, and badminton.

This space is dedicated to my personal projects and explorations in the world of technology.
